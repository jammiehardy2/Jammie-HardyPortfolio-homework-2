            With my current position at Aetna/CVS I have learned many new things
            concerning data management. While I have been an employee, I created
            8 different databases for different projects. I was given the task,
            conducted the research and built user friendly databaseâ€™s in order
            to save time and money. I was given many challenges to overcome,
            from being CAP Team leader, resolving employee issues and
            facilitating communications, to document and software management.
            The CAP (Change Acceleration Process) team was created to bring
            about a new direction to the project due to new ownership. As CAP
            Team Leader I was in charge of scheduling all meetings and presiding
            over each one. The team was comprised of roughly 20 people from all
            departments. We developed strategies to ensure that all goals were
            clear and attainable, and that each of the 150 employees supported
            the success of the campaign. Additionally, I have worked with
            approximately a hundred different contractors during our startup and
            expansion phases. CS Mining purchased project management software,
            and I was chosen to become the expert. I communicated with and
            trained the various contractors how to use the online based
            software. At times this was quite challenging because everyone,
            including CS employees, was very used to using their own preferred
            email programs, and were resistant to using the required project
            management software. The program did have a help line, but most
            people would call me to get the answers they needed. One gentleman
            even asked me why he should call them when I could work the issue in
            less than half the time. All of the contractors knew me and were
            more than willing to work with me on anything I needed. I gained
            long lasting relationships with most of them. In each and every
            department I solved employee issues, organized meetings and events,
            fixed technical issues, developed plans and procedures, designed
            excel documents, and produced flow charts.
